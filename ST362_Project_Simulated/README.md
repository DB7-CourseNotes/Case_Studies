# ST362 Simulated Data Sets

In this folder there are two data sets:

- `Exam_Scores.csv`
- `NBA_Points.csv`

These data sets were primarily simulated by students, with a few changes before uploading. 

For the second part of the project, you must choose *one* and analyse it. *You may not pick data that you simulated*.

```R
exam_scores <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DB7-CourseNotes/Case_Studies/main/ST362_Project_Simulated/Exam_Scores.csv")
```

```R
exam_scores <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DB7-CourseNotes/Case_Studies/main/ST362_Project_Simulated/NBA_Points.csv")
```
